The fog computing architectural model has recently seen advances with respect to bandwidth and latency issues.
However, since fog devices are deployed at the network edge and are not fully trustable, there are still security and privacy challenges.
In this paper, aiming at improving both communication efficiency and privacy protection, we propose a new efficient and privacy-preserving range query scheme in fog-based IoT. We, first, introduce a new decomposition technique to efficiently interpret a given range query $[L, U]$, where $0\leq L\leq U\leq n-1$, as a form of inverted reduced path strings. Then, the symmetric homomorphic encryption (SHE) scheme is employed to encrypt the reduced paths and hand them over securely through a fog node to the IoT devices. This technique enables a query user to launch a privacy-preserving continuous or non-continuous range query and receive a homomorphically aggregated encrypted response with an improved $O(\log^2n)$ communication efficiency. Detailed security analysis shows that our proposed scheme is privacy-preserving. In addition, extensive performance evaluations are also conducted, and the results demonstrate that our proposed scheme is by far more efficient than those previously reported schemes in terms of computational overhead and communication complexity.
